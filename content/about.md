Hi,

My name is **Akop Kesheshyan**, and I'm a Software Engineer. I specialize in finding technical solutions to business challenges.

I used to travel a lot, but now I live with my wife and daughter in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

My main areas of interest include **Deep Learning**, **Distributed Systems**, **Industrial Design**, **Knowledge Management**, and **Continuous Learning**. In my free time, I charge myself with a good cup of coffee (I'm a bit of a coffee nerd!) and enjoy playing the game of Go.

On my website, you'll find my personal notes on topics I care deeply about.

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to email me.
